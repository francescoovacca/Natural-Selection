# DarwinSim

DarwinSim is a project to simulate natural evolution. It models the dynamics of evolution through natural selection and genetic mutation in a virtual environment. 

### The idea
We will create a simulation environment where agents live and eat, but the food supply is fewer than the agents. We will start with random moving agents, but then will implement intelligent agents that try to survive. We will study how the population evolves at varying levels of food, as well as varying traits of the agent such as weight, velocity, and other features.

### Tech Stack
- **Main Languages**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: TBD

### Project Status
Adding features, squashing bugs and running experiments. Stay tuned!

### Setup and Run
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DarwinSim.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd DarwinSim`
- Install dependencies using Pipenv: `pipenv install`
- Activate the Pipenv shell: `pipenv shell`
- Run the simulation: `python simulate.py` or run experiments on notebook
